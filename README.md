## Introduction
CircuitNet aims to automate the conversion of hand-drawn circuit sketches into professional circuit diagrams using deep learning. The system combines traditional image processing for component detection with a CNN for classification, achieving 90% detection and 96.5% classification accuracy across 5 common circuit components.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 3,191 images (including augmented data). The original dataset was sourced from [mahmut-aksakalli/circuit_recognizer](https://github.com/mahmut-aksakalli/circuit_recognizer/blob/master/traindata.zip) and was further augmented to improve model performance.

The dataset is located in the `dataset/` directory of this repository and includes:
- Original circuit component images
- Augmented variations of the original images
- Additional handcrafted component images

#### Extract the dataset:

   ```bash
   cd dataset/
   tar -xzvf circuit_dataset.tar.gz
   ```

### Notebooks
- **neural_network.ipynb**: This notebook is where the neural network is trained to predict the circuit components.
- **object_detection.ipynb**: This notebook covers the image processing algorithm used to detect circuit components.
- **circuit_generation.ipynb**: This notebook takes the detected and classified components to generate an SVG/PNG of the circuit.


### Component Classification

The component classification model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 5 classes: resistor, capacitor, inductor, voltage source, and current source. The model achieved an accuracy of 96.5% on the test set.

### Component Segmentation

There are a variety of feature detection algorithms possible, but we opted for traditional image processing techniques due to the inavailability of labeled data.

### Circuit Generation

The circuit generation pipeline transforms detected components into a complete circuit diagram through a three-stage process. First, the detected and classified components are processed to establish their spatial relationships and mapped to standardized circuit elements. Next, these processed components are used to automatically generate a JSON netlist that defines all component connections while preserving the original circuit topology. Finally, this netlist is rendered into an SVG circuit diagram using a rule-based placement system, which can then be exported to PNG format for easy visualization
